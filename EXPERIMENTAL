║Welcome to the EXPERIMENTAL section. The analyses here are incomplete, buggy, ║
║and generally not ready for prime time (as if anything else in this repo is). ║
║If all you want to do is georeference some transects for visual classification║
║turn back now. This isn't your final warning, but I'm not going to make a poi-║
║n't to keep bringing it up. If you decide you want to try these analyses, see ║
║the build section of this document for information on how to include it in yo-║
║ur copy of my program. Also check the included analyses and maturity section  ║
║to determine the suitability of this software for what you want to do. Lastly ║
║I strongly encourage you to read the corresponding section describing the ana-║
║lysis in this document. If you've heeded all of my warnings and still feel th-║
║is is right for you, good luck! I hope you find this code helpful.            ║

║I would be remiss to not acknowledge that my motivation for attempting this   ║
║analysis was based on my inability to get Dan Buscombe (dbuscombe.github.io)'s║
║PyHum to run in the year of our lord 2021. Why Python needed to obsolete deca-║
║des of other peoples' code is beyond the scope of this document. This code is ║
║different from the E1 and E2 analysis in PyHum in several key ways, the ratio-║
║nale for which I will include below. I also have no desire to recreate PyHum, ║
║nor use a fully automatic method to classify substrate. If this is your goal  ║
║more power to you, feel free to use my code in your project.                  ║
║                                                                              ║
║This analysis is not super complicated, and I'd recommend Dan Buscombe's 2017 ║
║paper as well as Barb Faggetter's documentation at Oceanecology.ca as invalua-║
║ble resources for understanding what is going on (citations below). Also I'd  ║
║like to extend a huge thank you here to both of these folks for the huge      ║
║amount of work that they have both done!                                      ║
╟──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────╢
║E1 and E2 analysis is a method of using the strength of returns in the first  ║
║and second sonar echos to classify substrate. The first echo is the direct ba-║
║ckscatter from the substrate (ie the wave front has propagated from the trans-║
║ducer to the bottom and reflected directly back). The second echo is the back-║
║scatter from the bottom after the wave front has reflected off the bottom, re-║
║flected off the surface, and then reflected off the bottom again.             ║
║                                                                              ║
║Researchers have noticed that the strength of the first echo roughly correspo-║
║nds to the roughness of the substrate, and the second roughly corresponds to  ║
║its reflectivity (hardness). There are reasons why this isn't always the case ║
║but this is documentation and I'm a biologist. See the recommended reading for║
║more info.                                                                    ║
║                                                                              ║
║Measuring the strength of each echo involves taking the area under the curve  ║
║of these two peaks, and correcting them for water attenuation and noise. The  ║
║units are an area over a volume (an inverse length), and are traditionally    ║
║reported in inverse nautical miles. We won't worry about units here for a few ║
║reasons, not the least of which being that surface and environmental conditio-║
║ns affect results enough that literature-reported values are useless for clas-║
║sification in most situations anyway. It is important to test these values ag-║
║ainst known substrates in the system you are using them in.                   ║
║                                                                              ║
║Classification is typically accomplished using a clustering algorithm. Both   ║
║Faggetter and Buscombe use k-means clustering and I think that is a solid opt-║
║ion. I do no automatic clustering here so I'll leave that part up to you.     ║
║                                                                              ║
║Currently this software does not factor in water attenuation of the signal and║
║assumes the returns reported by the instrument are logarithmic. Please see be-║
║low for the missing information that is necessary to do this analysis right.  ║
╟──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────╢
║Things we need to know to do this right but don't know. As far as I know      ║
╟──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────╢
║1. What do the return values in the binary file correspond to? This is extrem-║
║   ely important for factoring in water attenuation, which is expressed in the║
║   equation I borrowed from Barb Faggetter in decibel watts. Buscombe (2017)  ║
║   assumes that the maximum return (255) is equal to the power output from the║
║   unit. I'm not going to call that assumption unreasonable, but I would not  ║
║   design the instrument in this way. Further, returns of 255 are common even ║
║   10+ m down. I think the assumption that 0 is no return is very reasonable. ║
║   Faggetter represents return values in Sv, representing a variation in dyna-║
║   mic range assumed to be 70dB. This may partially answer the next question. ║
║2. Similarly, are the returns linear or logarithmic? I can think of a few ways║
║   to set up an ADC to read amplitude, and assume that a direct measurement   ║
║   from a DAC sampling at least twice as fast as the frequency (in this case  ║
║   the DAC would need to be in the ballpark of 1 Mhz), would produce a linear ║
║   response; but if the signal is rectified and used to charge a capacitor,   ║
║   and then read by a slower ADC, the response would likely be logarithmic. I ║
║   am assuming the response is logarithmic but am unwilling to disassemble my ║
║   fishfinder to find out.                                                    ║
╟──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────╢
║Problems that will always plague this analysis that I don't think can be fixed║
╟──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────╢
║1. Clipping. The return is expressed as an 8-bit unsigned integer. The energy ║
║   responsible for the maximum return of 255 is unknown, but if it, as I susp-║
║   ect, is lower than the output power, returns higher than 255 are probably  ║
║   recorded as 255. The area under the curve of strong peaks in this analysis ║
║   will always be underestimated in a way that is related to the number of re-║
║   turns that are recorded as 255 but should be higher. This probably transla-║
║   tes to unreliable results in shallow depths at an unknown depth cutoff tha-║
║   t likely depends on substrate and the particular noise environment in the  ║
║   study area.                                                                ║
║2. Unknown variability between instruments. Signal strength and gain will vary║
║   within manufacturing tolerences that we just don't know. I suspect they are║
║   not super stringent considering that the intended use of this device is in-║
║   situ visual interpretation in a recreational setting.                      ║
║3. To my knowledge we don't know whether the instrument dynamically adjusts   ║
║   its gain, output, or the duration of its pings. If it does any of these th-║
║   ings and doesn't record the corresponding adjustments, there is no meaning-║
║   ful way to compare the results of this analysis.                           ║

╟──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────╢
║Considerations if you decide to use this software for analysis                ║
╟──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────╢
║1. You are using a recreational fish finder to do science. If you have the fu-║
║   nding to not do this, please consider using it. An ADCP, multi-beam unit,  ║
║   or properly calibrated, research-grade sonar unit that gives returns in dB ║
║   Watts will keep you from pulling out your hair over the analysis 🙃.       ║
║2. Currently water attenuation is not factored in to this analysis. This means║
║   that E1 and E2 values will not scale correctly with depth. If your study   ║
║   site has a relatively consistent depth, this might not matter (congrats you║
║   lucky SOB). Otherwise you will need a way to include depth in your analysis║
║   (bin similar depths before clustering, etc.)                               ║
║3. Be comfortable with my assumptions, don't use this analysis, or modify the ║
║   code to your own ends. I've given my rationale for the assumptions I've ma-║
║   de, but the numbers will be wildly wrong if, for instance, returns are act-║
║   ually linear. YMMV                                                         ║
║4. Consider the first unresolvable problem: there is almost certainly a minim-║
║   um depth that this analysis will work in and I can't tell you what it is.  ║
║   You might be able to figure it out by looking at some lines to see the max-║
║   imum return in the depth peak. I expect that the minimum useful depth is   ║
║   the maximum depth at which values of 255 regularly occur in the depth peak.║
║   You might be able to use a statistical method to correct for the clipping, ║
║   though I don't know one offhand, or you might get away with running the an-║
║   alysis anyway if your system has a relatively constant depth. Again YMMV   ║
║5. The units reported by this software are non-standard and likely not report-║
║   able in the literature without referencing how they were calculated.       ║
║6. This is an extremely experimental program written by a fish biologist with ║
║   too much free time during a global pandemic. If you find it useful, more   ║
║   power to you. If it breaks your computer, c'est la vie. Back up your data  ║
║   often, keep your coffee pot full, and be prepared for the unexpected.      ║
║7. If you've read this far and you still want to give this a try. Godspeed.   ║

╠══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╣
║Finding and verifying depth is an important step for getting reliable data out║
║of signal analyses. The unit does an internal calculation of depth that seems ║
║reasonably reliable. I've included some functions for detecting peaks indepen-║
║dently with the aim of creating a reliable method for determining the width of║
║the return peaks. The procedure used by the peak detection function follows:  ║
║                                                                              ║
║1. Open a line (the returns associated with a single ping).                   ║
║2. Compute a running average (μ) ending with the return being analyzed.       ║
║3. If the return (r) was different from μ by A standard deviations (σ) classi-║
║   fy the return as part of a peak. Record its location.                      ║
║   D = r > μ + A * σ                                                          ║
║   D = r < μ - A * σ                                                          ║
║4. If the return was classified as a peak, reduce r toward the mean by 1/3.   ║
║   r = 0.67 * (r0 - μ) + μ                                                    ║
║   This increases the probability of classifying subsequent returns as part of║

║A version of this analysis tuned to be somewhat more reliable than what I am  ║
║currently doing could allow depth calculation independent of the unit's inter-║
║nal calculation (read: fully user-specifiable speed of sound). It is also a   ║
║starting point for the noise classification and peak width calculation detail-║
║ed in the next section. Peak detection could also be helpful for automated cl-║
║assification methods using the side-imaging transducers (shoreline detection, ║
║rock detection, etc.). Noise reduction is also potentially helpful for image  ║
║clarification in the side-imaging TIFFs, but is not currently used in this way║

║Automatic noise floor and peak width calculation:                             ║
╠══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╣
║Noise is calculated in two ways in this software. The noise used in calculati-║
║ng E is, by definition, backscatter from the water column and is the average  ║
║return prior to the peak corresponding the depth. Noise is also necesary for  ║
║determining the breadth of the first two peaks. This noise floor is defined by║
║the water column noise plus the continuous component of the backscatter from  ║
║the bottom (the ringing caused by the wave front outside of the beam width and║
║local echos between different parts of the substrate that return at unpredict-║
║able times). Since the water column noise is part of these returns anyway, we ║
║can ignore it for this algorithm. The ringing reduces over time, and the impo-║
║rtant component is the space between the tail end of the first echo and the   ║
║beginning of the second. This software calculates the noise floor using the   ║
║following procedure:                                                          ║
║                                                                              ║
║1. Determine the location in the line of the peaks associated with both echos.║
║2. Select a (roughly) 1 metre section of the line to sample for noise:        ║
║   2a. If the second echo is more than 2 metres from the first, select the me-║
║       re surrounding the midpoint between the two.                           ║
║   2b. If the second echo is less than 2 metres from the first (the depth is  ║
║       less than 2 metres), select a one-metre section of the line 1.5 metres ║
║       after the second echo.                                                 ║
║3. Scan through the selected noise region and calculate the average return.   ║
║4. Set the noise floor ten percent higher than the average noise return. This ║
║   is done to remove noise from the noise floor. lol                          ║
║5. Adjust the peak widths so that they start and end with the first value     ║
║   above the noise floor and the first value below the noise floor, respectiv-║
║   ely.                                                                       ║

║How I use this in the included analyses:                                      ║

║The breadth of a return is an important component in calculating the area und-║
║er the curve (E1 or E2). Buscombe (2017) circumvents this calculation by defi-║
║ning the echos using the geometry of the transducer. Whether or not this is a ║
║reliable method of comparison is beyond the scope of my knowledge. Faggetter  ║
║uses the height of the signal over the noise floor (as I've detailed here) as ║
║a method for determining the breadth of the peak. I favour this method as it  ║
║is not dependent on defining the geometry of the wave-front (using specs from ║
║the instrument that aren't to my knowledge publicly documented). It also fact-║
║ors in the entire peak.                                                       ║
║                                                                              ║
║I'm not sure if this noise floor should be the noise subtracted from the area ║
║under the curve in lieu of the water column noise when calculating E1 or E2. I║
║will leave this to the experts. If you are an expert, please let me know.     ║
║                                                                              ║
║The noise floor calculation used here may be useful in correcting the drop-off║
║in side-imaging returns associated with attenuation or as a way of calculating║
║water attenuation in a sneaky way that relates it directly to the recorded re-║
║turn strength, without needing to know the maximum return. I need to do some  ║
║thinking about this, hit the literature, or be told. If you know, please cons-║
║ider sharing your knowledge with me!                                          ║
