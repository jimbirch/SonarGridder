# SonarGridder
A C++ program for simple georeferencing of Humminbird side scan sonar files. Intended for visual substrate classification using side scan sonar records and a GIS program of your choice. Outputs (regular) TIFF files with world files indicating how to stretch and rotate them onto the map. Corrects cross-track distance and poor gps resolution. Tested with the Humminbird 598ci HD, will likely work with other units of the same generation but may require some modification to the header to adjust the sonar header length and the offsets of particular important sonar header values. TIFF files import into QGIS without difficulty, I have not tested them with any other software.

The approach is to divide the boat's track into segments where the heading is relatively constant, correct the across track distances, write a TIFF file containing the data within each segment, and then write a world file (TFW) describing how to stretch and rotate the image to a map. This approach improves legibility over gridding methods dependent on boat heading and radiometric correction at the expense of some spatial accuracy (ie MBSystem).

Depends on LibTIFF, adjust the makefile to point to where your system stores it.
